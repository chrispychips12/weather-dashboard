User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

I have created a weather dashboard with form inputs
```
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```


Some of the features I included in this dashboard are:

- Bootstrap for styling elements
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
- OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data
- Javascript to create the functionality of the dashboard
- Google Maps API to retrieve the latitude and longitude of the city
- Local Storage to store the search history
- CSS for styling
- HTML for the structure of the dashboard
- Functions to display the weather data
- Functions to display the search history
- Functions to display the current weather
- Functions to display the 5-day forecast
- Functions to display the UV index
- Hover effect for the search history
- Loading cursor when the data is being retrieved
- Error message when the city is not found
- Clear button to clear the search history
